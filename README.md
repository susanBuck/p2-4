Notes for instructor
* Designed so that it goes from main page to a confirmation page after submission. 
* Note that this is different from the idea put forward in last week's assignment. I found that that project was too much for me with my current capabilities. Will keep it in mind should it fit another assignment down the road. 
* Struggled to make the SESSIONS work and error-alert occur. The validation does occur, redirecting back to index.php.
